Description: It shows the software architecture of the system. 

Viewpoints: This model has development view, it describes the architecture that supports the development process. It also has the context view as well which describes the 

relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environment.

Stakeholders: Firstly, it shows the architecture of the system which is interesting to programers who want to develop it. At the same time, the context view is interesting to 
all stakeholder, in particular, users and acquirers.

# 2. Use Case Diagram

Description: The diagram demonstrates use case scenario of TU/e parking system. 

Viewpoints: The diagram concerns logical view and scenario view. Three stakeholders are involved. External visitors can park and pay parking fee with the system. Employees can not only have the basic parking service, but also can manage their own accounts. Admins can use the system to manage the user account and parking services.

# 3. Sequence Diagram

Description: This Chart shows the communication between different parts and interaction between  users and system in different scenarios.

Viewpoints: It has the process view and scenarios view. It shows how the process goes in different scenarios

Stakeholders: This diagram is interesting for system integrators and tester who must see whether the timing of event is working well. At the same time, it is also interesting for the user or the businessman who want to buy this system. They will know if the system is performing well.
